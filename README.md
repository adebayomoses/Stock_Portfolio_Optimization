# Stock_Portfolio_Optimization

## Objectives:
In this case study, I will build two $500,000 investment portfolios containing four stocks. The first portfolio will have an equal weighting between the stocks. The second portfolio will be optimized with a weighting allocation that provides the best return, adjusted for risk. To build these two portfolios, we will:


## Outlines:
Imported two years of data for four stocks(AAPL, MSFT, ORCL,G).

Creating the initial portfolio with equal weighting to each of the stocks.

Analyzing and visualizing the equal-weighted portfolio.

Generating $500,000 portfolio scenarios with random weighting to each of the stocks.

Identifying the optimal portfolio from the scenarios and visualizing the results.
